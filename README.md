hallelujahIM
============

hallelujahIM is  an english input method with auto-suggestions and spell check features, mac only.

1. The auto suggestion words come from google's  [1/3 million most frequent English words](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt). I have purged it to 227800 words (all wrong words removed). Candidates words are sorted by frequency.
2. hallelujahIM is also a spell-checker, when you input wrong word, it will give you the right candidates.
3. It will show phonetic symbol of your selected word.
4. You can swith to the default English input mode by press the `shift` key. Press `shift` again, it switch to the auto-suggestion mode.
