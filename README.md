hallelujahIM
============

hallelujahIM is  an english input method with auto-suggestions and spell check features, mac only.

1. The auto suggestion words come from google's  [1/3 million most frequent English words](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt). I cleanup it to 227800 words (all wrong words removed).
2. hallelujahIM is also a spell-checker, when you input wrong word, it will give you the right candidates.
